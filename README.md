# A machine learning model from John Hopkins University

## Synposis:
This is a machine learning model that predicts a person's excercise performance quality (graded A to E) based on their human activity recognition (HAR) data during weightlifting. The model predicts what grade a person would get based on how far their body is moving/skewed in the x, y and z dimensions.

## What's in this folder:
The current files in this main folder include the **RDS** (saved file of just the model's data/predictions alone, to make processing faster). Also included are an .Rmd file used to write out a report/synopsis on how I built the model, as well as the results it found.

The `.Rmd` was then converted to `.HTML` and `.md` versions of the same report. I converted the `.Rmd` into `.HTML` and `.md` versions and uploaded them for easier legibility. The `.HTML` version of the report can be viewed immediately in one's browser, while the `.md` one can be viewed immediately in GitHub (like this current file). 

The "`Predictreport_files/figure-html`" folder in this repository contains ALL the plots + graphics (such as random forest and word plots) which were generated from, and alongside, the machine learning model.

## Why did I make this model/where did the original dataset and idea for this model come from?
This is part of the "Data Science" Coursera Specialization, Course 8, from John Hopkins.
